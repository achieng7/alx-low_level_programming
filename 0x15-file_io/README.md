C - File I/O

This is a beginner's guide to File I/O in C programming language. File I/O is an important aspect of C programming as it allows the programs to interact with the files on the file system.
Opening a File

In order to read from or write to a file, you first need to open it. The open() function is used to open a file and it returns a file descriptor. The syntax for opening a file is as follows:

perl

int file_descriptor = open("filename", oflag [,mode]);

Here, filename is the name of the file, oflag specifies the mode in which the file is opened, and mode specifies the permissions to be set on the file in case it is created.
Modes of File Opening

The oflag parameter of the open() function specifies the mode in which the file is opened. Here are some of the commonly used modes:

    O_RDONLY: opens the file in read-only mode.
    O_WRONLY: opens the file in write-only mode.
    O_RDWR: opens the file in read-write mode.
    O_CREAT: creates the file if it doesn't exist.
    O_TRUNC: truncates the file if it already exists.
    O_APPEND: appends to the file instead of overwriting it.

Closing a File

After you have finished working with a file, it is important to close it. The close() function is used to close a file. The syntax for closing a file is as follows:

arduino

int close(int file_descriptor);

Here, file_descriptor is the file descriptor returned by the open() function.
Reading from a File

Once you have opened a file in read mode, you can read from it using the read() function. The syntax for reading from a file is as follows:

arduino

ssize_t read(int file_descriptor, void *buffer, size_t count);

Here, file_descriptor is the file descriptor returned by the open() function, buffer is a pointer to the buffer where the data is read into, and count is the number of bytes to be read.
Writing to a File

Once you have opened a file in write mode, you can write to it using the write() function. The syntax for writing to a file is as follows:

arduino

ssize_t write(int file_descriptor, const void *buffer, size_t count);

Here, file_descriptor is the file descriptor returned by the open() function, buffer is a pointer to the buffer where the data to be written is stored, and count is the number of bytes to be written.
Conclusion

This was a brief introduction to File I/O in C programming language. File I/O is an important concept in C programming and is used extensively in real-world applications. Understanding how to interact with files is crucial for any C programmer.
